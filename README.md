🧭 Project Title:
Real-Time Stock Ticker
💡 Project Overview

The Real-Time Stock Ticker is a dynamic web-based application that displays live stock prices, market trends, and historical insights using real-time data from financial APIs such as Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Polygon.io.
It allows users to monitor and analyze stock performance through an interactive dashboard that updates automatically without manual page refreshes.

The system employs WebSocket-based communication to push live updates to the client, ensuring instant synchronization with market data. Advanced encryption and decryption mechanisms are used to maintain data security during transmission.

🎯 Project Objectives

To provide instant updates of stock prices and market movements in real time.

To enable users to track selected stocks and view historical performance charts.

To ensure data confidentiality and integrity through end-to-end encryption.

To create a responsive and interactive dashboard for better user experience.

To integrate AI-driven trend analysis and predictions for future insights.

🕒 Historical Data	Users can analyze historical performance of selected stocks.
🔔 Custom Alerts	Notifies users when a stock crosses a predefined price threshold.
🔐 Secure Communication	Uses AES-GCM encryption and HMAC verification for secure real-time data transfer.
📱 Responsive UI	Works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
🧠 Smart Insights (Optional)	Uses predictive models to highlight potential trends.
🏗️ System Architecture

1. Data Source Layer:
External APIs such as Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Polygon.io provide real-time stock price feeds in JSON format.

2. Server Layer (Node.js / Express.js):

Fetches real-time stock prices from the financial APIs.

Encrypts messages using AES-256-GCM.

Signs payloads using HMAC-SHA256 to ensure integrity.

Broadcasts updates to all connected clients via WebSocket.

3. Client Layer (React.js / HTML / JavaScript):

Receives encrypted messages.

Verifies signature and decrypts data using Web Crypto API.

Dynamically updates stock charts and tables.

Provides interactive options for filtering and comparing stocks.

🔄 Workflow

Data Fetching:
Server periodically fetches updated stock data from financial APIs.

Encryption & Signing (Server Side):

Each stock update is encrypted using AES-GCM (256-bit key).

A unique IV (Initialization Vector) is generated for each message.

HMAC-SHA256 signature ensures that no one has tampered with the payload.

Transmission:
Encrypted payloads are sent to clients via secure WSS (WebSocket Secure) channel.

Decryption & Verification (Client Side):

Client receives the envelope: {iv, ct, tag, ts, sig}.

Verifies signature using shared HMAC key.

Decrypts message using AES key (matching the server key).

Updates the UI in real time.

Display:
The decrypted JSON (e.g., {"symbol": "AAPL", "price": 189.53, "timestamp": "..."}) is shown in the dashboard.

🔐 Data Encryption & Decryption Logic
Encryption (Server Side – Node.js)
import crypto from 'crypto';

const AES_KEY = crypto.randomBytes(32); // 256-bit key
const HMAC_KEY = crypto.randomBytes(32);

function encryptStockData(data) {
  const iv = crypto.randomBytes(12);
  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv("aes-256-gcm", AES_KEY, iv);
  const ciphertext = Buffer.concat([cipher.update(JSON.stringify(data)), cipher.final()]);
  const authTag = cipher.getAuthTag();

  const payload = {
    iv: iv.toString("base64"),
    ct: ciphertext.toString("base64"),
    tag: authTag.toString("base64"),
    ts: new Date().toISOString()
  };

  const hmac = crypto.createHmac("sha256", HMAC_KEY);
  hmac.update(payload.iv + "." + payload.ct + "." + payload.tag + "." + payload.ts);
  payload.sig = hmac.digest("base64");

  return payload;
}

Decryption (Client Side – JavaScript/WebCrypto)
async function decryptPayload(payload, aesKey, hmacKey) {
  const { iv, ct, tag, ts, sig } = payload;

  // 1. Verify signature
  const dataStr = iv + "." + ct + "." + tag + "." + ts;
  const enc = new TextEncoder().encode(dataStr);
  const sigBytes = Uint8Array.from(atob(sig), c => c.charCodeAt(0));

  const verified = await crypto.subtle.verify(
    { name: "HMAC" },
    hmacKey,
    sigBytes,
    enc
  );

  if (!verified) throw new Error("Invalid signature");

  // 2. Decrypt AES-GCM
  const ivBuf = Uint8Array.from(atob(iv), c => c.charCodeAt(0));
  const ctBuf = Uint8Array.from(atob(ct), c => c.charCodeAt(0));
  const tagBuf = Uint8Array.from(atob(tag), c => c.charCodeAt(0));
  const combined = new Uint8Array(ctBuf.length + tagBuf.length);
  combined.set(ctBuf);
  combined.set(tagBuf, ctBuf.length);

  const plainBuf = await crypto.subtle.decrypt(
    { name: "AES-GCM", iv: ivBuf, tagLength: 128 },
    aesKey,
    combined
  );

  const text = new TextDecoder().decode(plainBuf);
  return JSON.parse(text);
}
